# UH-Team-A
Spa Resource Management System Prototype Project

### Some basic Git commands and project setup.

Once you have created a directory on your computer for the project,
Navigate to the team repository setup by Mark and click the green button
'clone or download' Choose your preferred option and get the contents into
project directory.

 *** { } These braces indicate other text, they are not required. ***

From a terminal you can type: git clone {and paste the url proved by the green button}

This will perform a request for the resources from Git to be placed into your directory.

You are now on what's known as the master branch of the repository. The master branch is to be kept
safe, as developers we create another branch from the master and perform our coding on them. When
ready we create merge requests to the master branch which can then be code reviewed by each other.
Once the team is happy with the changes the code can be merged and the feature branch deleted.
We continue in this way until all features are completed.

To create a branch type: git checkout -b {your chosen branch name}
This command will create the branch and move you to the branch ready to work.

### Codeignitor directory

I have also added a folder to the project which contains the Codeignitor
framework. I have also followed the first part of this tutorial to add some
routing and additional pages.

Downloading MAMP or WAMP and placing the project repo inside MAMPS htdoc folder will
start up the application.
